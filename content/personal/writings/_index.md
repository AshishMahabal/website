Besides the scientific papers and a few popular science articles, I have been writing
science-fiction in Marathi for the last few years. I write short-stories,
mostly hard sci-fi, and they have been published in leading Marathi magazines
as well as well-known online sites, and a few anthologies. I have also written
some travelogues, including a few that are predominantly picture-based.
